# Lodgify JavaScript application conventions

An **inexhaustive** definition of Lodgify's conventions for writing JavaScript applications.

## Goals

Each convention seeks to achieve one or more of the following goals, ordered by priority.

##### Make life easier

Make logic easy to read. Improve signal to noise ratio. Reduce mental burden in understanding.

##### Reduce the chance of failure

Make logic easy to test. Choose the tight way (`===`), not the loose way (`==`).

##### Move faster

Make logic easy to reuse. Reduce mental burden in writing.

## Conventions

## Be warned

This is consciously **inexhaustive**.

If something isn't covered here, fall back to a sensible convention in [AirBnB](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) or [make a contribution](#contributions). When another convention conflicts with a convention here, follow the one here.

## Contributions

Use the [convention template](CONVENTION_TEMPLATE.md) and open a PR into master branch.
